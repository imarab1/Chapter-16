You may assist your fellow students but do **NOT** share answers/code.

- Add the methods push and pop to LinkedIntList so that it can behave like a Stack.

This repo contains a dummy JUnit test case. You need to add your own test cases to thoroughly test you code.
If you are using an IDE other than Geany, you must ensure that your code still passes all when run via GitHub Actions.

Be sure to document your source code with Javadoc and update this README. Please contact me if you need assistance.
